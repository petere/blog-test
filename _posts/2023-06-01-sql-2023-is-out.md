The news today is that SQL:2023, the new version of the SQL standard,
has been published by ISO.

Here are links to the parts on the ISO web site:

(Note, if you want to purchase a copy, you probably only want part 2,
unless you intend to work in the particular areas covered by the other
parts.)

[Here]({% post_url 2023-04-04-sql-2023-is-finished-here-is-whats-new
%}) is my previous article on what is new in SQL:2023, and [here]({%
post_url 2023-04-18-postgresql-and-sql:2023 %}) is the article on the
status of SQL:2023 support in PostgreSQL.

Incidentally, the next SQL working group meeting is in less than two
weeks' time, and work on the next version will start then.
